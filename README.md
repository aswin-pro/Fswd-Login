## Full-Stack Login Authentication
This project demonstrates a basic full-stack implementation of a login authentication system using Express.js on the backend and React.js on the frontend. The application checks if the user-provided credentials match the predefined values on the server and navigates to different pages based on the result.

## Usage
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
- Enter the following credentials to log in:
- Name: aswin
- Email: aswin@gmail.com
- Contact: 1234567890
- Password: 123
- Click the "Login" button.
- If the credentials are correct, you will be redirected to a success page. Otherwise, you will be redirected to a failure page.

## Technologies Used
## Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- CORS
## Frontend:
- React.js
- Axios
- TailwindCSS
  
## Features
- Basic login form with fields for username, password, email, and contact number.
- Backend validation of user credentials.
- Conditional navigation based on authentication success or failure.
